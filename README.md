# CS-305-Software-Security
Module Eight

## Who was the client?
Artemis Financial wanted to modernize their operations. They requested a software vulnerability assessment.

## What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
Applying industry best practices adds value because it prevents problems before they occur. If company data was compromised, it could take large amounts of resources to remedy the situation. It also helps avoid costly lawsuits and stay in compliance with government regulations. A company’s public image can be affected by the security of its data. Poor public perception could lead to loss of sales and scare potential customers.

## What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The code given to us from SNHU didn't always work on its own. There would be problems outside of what was presented in the assignemnt. For example, Spring had issues that had to be fixed before the assignment could be completed. This took a lot of time to fix.

## How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
In the future I would use dependency checks to assess vulnerabilities. 

## How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
By adding security features such as HTTPS. Running the dependency check again after refactoring provided indication that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

## What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
Spring, Maven, and the keytool generator could be useful in future assignments.
